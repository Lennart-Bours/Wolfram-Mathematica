## Overview
A collection of Wolfram Mathematica packages and notebooks I wrote and used during my PhD thesis. The main files are briefly described below.

"SuperPackage" and "TSQUIPT thermal transport" were used for the computational modelling of the electronic and thermal transport properties of superconductor - 2 dimensional insulator - superconductor junction (also known as topological Josephson junction or TJJ) based devices. Parts of the code shared here were used to calculate the results presented in the following scientific papers:

> **I** *Topological SQUIPT Based on Helical Edge States in Proximity to Superconductors*  
> by **L. Bours**, B. Sothmann, M. Carrega, E. Strambini, E. M. Hankiewicz, L. W. Molenkamp, and F. Giazotto.  
> Phys. Rev. Applied 10, 014027 - Published 25 July 2018.  
> DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.10.014027

and

> **II** *Phase-Tunable Thermal Rectification in the Topological SQUIPT*  
> by **L. Bours**, B. Sothmann, M. Carrega, E. Strambini, A. Braggio, E. M. Hankiewicz, L. W. Molenkamp, and F. Giazotto.  
> Phys. Rev. Appl. 11, 044073 - Published 23 April 2019.  
> DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.11.044073

"SuperDataAnalysis" and "2. Ionic liquid data analysis" were used for analysing data collected in magneto-transport experiments on the topic of 'gate-controlled superconductivity'. The data and code were used in the work underlying following papers:

> **III** *Unveiling mechanisms of electric field effects on superconductors by a magnetic field response*  
> by **L. Bours**, M. T. Mercaldo, M. Cuoco, E. Strambini and F. Giazotto  
> Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 033353, - Published 2 September 2020  
> DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033353

and

> **IV** *Electrostatic field-driven supercurrent suppression in ionic-gated metallic Josephson nanotransistors*  
> by F. Paolucci, F. CrisÃ , G. De Simoni, **L Bours**, C. Puglia, E. Strambini, S. Roddaro, F. Giazotto  
> Prepublished on arXiv on 5 July 2021: arXiv:2107.00935

## SuperPackage (package)
The Notebook titled "SuperPackage.nb" is setup to automatically create the package "SuperPackage.m", which has been used in the notebook "1. TSQUIPT thermal transport". The package contains a collection of functions which describe the properties of a superconductor - 2D topological insulator - superconductor junction, such as the electrical and thermal conductance for various configurations.

Note that the package requires the two .dat files "gapnew" and "SuperElectronPhonon_Tc1.3K_gamma5x10^-4_Tbath25mK_mod" to be in the same folder.

## 1. TSQUIPT thermal transport (modelling)
This notebook shows how the thermal transport properties of the TSQUIPT were calculated, using the "SuperPackage". This extract contains calculations of the thermal conductance, the non-linear heat current, and thermal rectification of the device. These results are part of publication **II**.

## SuperDataAnalysis (package)
This package contains a suite of standard functions that were used to import and analyse experimental data collected using a custom LabVIEW program. Using this package, you can load .dat files. The data files structure is automatically recognized (i.e. the number of sweeps and column names), so the data can easily be partitioned in whatever way is convenient for further analysis. Besides some generic data manipulation functions, the package also provides a set of functions which detect when a superconducting device switches to the normal state using IV measurements, since this functionality was commonly required in my experiments.

## 2. Ionic liquid data analysis (data analysis)
This notebook contains data collected during a measurement on 'gate-controlled superconductivity via ionic liquid gating', and the results are part of paper **IV**. All the data of this set of measurements has been analysed, and the results are saved in dataset objects, which are in turn saved in the data file "Nb_DB_13_datasets". The notebook contains a "Measurement example", which shows how the raw data is analysed and saved. It also contains a few plots and fits that illustrate the extracted results.

Note that this notebook uses the file "Nb_DB_13_datasets", which contains all the data extracted from the raw measurements.
