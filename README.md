# Wolfram-Mathematica
A collection of Wolfram Mathematica notebooks and packages I wrote and used during my PhD thesis

Files 1, 2 and 3 were used for the computational modelling of electronic and thermal transport through superconductor - 2 dimensional insulator - superconductor junctions (also known as topological Josephson junctions or TJJs) based devices. Parts of the code shared here was used to calculate the results presented in these two scientific papers:

``Topological SQUIPT Based on Helical Edge States in Proximity to Superconductors'' by L. Bours, B. Sothmann, M. Carrega, E. Strambini, E. M. Hankiewicz, L. W. Molenkamp, and F. Giazotto. 
Phys. Rev. Applied 10, 014027 - Published 25 July 2018. 
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.10.014027

``Phase-Tunable Thermal Rectification in the Topological SQUIPT'' by L. Bours, B. Sothmann, M. Carrega, E. Strambini, A. Braggio, E. M. Hankiewicz, L. W. Molenkamp, and F. Giazotto. 
Phys. Rev. Appl. 11, 044073 - Published 23 April 2019. 
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.11.044073

Files 4, 5 and 6 were used for analyzing data collected in magneto-transport experiments.
