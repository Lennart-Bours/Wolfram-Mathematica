## Overview
A collection of Wolfram Mathematica notebooks and packages I wrote and used during my PhD thesis

Files 1, 2 and 3 were used for the computational modelling of electronic and thermal transport through superconductor - 2 dimensional insulator - superconductor junctions (also known as topological Josephson junctions or TJJs) based devices. Parts of the code shared here was used to calculate the results presented in these two scientific papers:

*Topological SQUIPT Based on Helical Edge States in Proximity to Superconductors* by L. Bours, B. Sothmann, M. Carrega, E. Strambini, E. M. Hankiewicz, L. W. Molenkamp, and F. Giazotto. 
Phys. Rev. Applied 10, 014027 - Published 25 July 2018.

and

*Phase-Tunable Thermal Rectification in the Topological SQUIPT* by L. Bours, B. Sothmann, M. Carrega, E. Strambini, A. Braggio, E. M. Hankiewicz, L. W. Molenkamp, and F. Giazotto. 
Phys. Rev. Appl. 11, 044073 - Published 23 April 2019. 
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.11.044073

Files 4, 5 and 6 were used for analyzing data collected in magneto-transport experiments on the topic of 'gate-controlled superconductivity'. The data and analysis are part of the following papers:

*Unveiling mechanisms of electric field effects on superconductors by a magnetic field response* by L. Bours, M. T. Mercaldo, M. Cuoco, E. Strambini and F. Giazotto
Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 033353, - Published 2 September 2020

and 

*Electrostatic field-driven supercurrent suppression in ionic-gated metallic Josephson nanotransistors* by Federico Paolucci, Francesco Cris√†, Giorgio De Simoni, Lennart Bours, Claudio Puglia, Elia Strambini, Stefano Roddaro, Francesco Giazotto
